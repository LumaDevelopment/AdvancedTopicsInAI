# Quasi-Newton Methods

This folder contains a presentation on the quasi-Newton methods of optimization and a demo comparing the performance of conjugate gradient methods and quasi-Newton methods on multiple functions.

## Files:
- **`QuasiNewtonMethods.pptx`** / **`QuasiNewtonMethods.pdf`** – Presentation covering the theory of quasi-Newton methods and walking through the implementation of the Broyden–Fletcher–Goldfarb–Shanno (BFGS) algorithm in SciPy, with theory-driven annotations.
- **`cg_vs_quasi_newton.py`** – Demo comparing the performance of conjugate gradient methods and quasi-Newton methods. [Adapted from this file.](https://github.com/LumaDevelopment/AdvancedTopicsInAI/blob/main/ConjugateGradient/polak_ribiere.py)
